var questions = [
{
    text: "what is steakhouse name?",
    choices: ["bingus", "bongo", "angus" "stingus"],
    answer: "angus", OR the correct string

},
];

go into this with a gameplan

try and figure out what it looks like before you build it

right now, they are simple... eventually they will become more complicated

maybe use adobeXD to plan out the project first


Things to figure out...

how to keep track of high scores

how to format questions - maybe store them all in an array, then an object? 

how to use the timer


ideas to start

layout html..

on click, hide the menu screen

    this can be accomplished by setting the display to none

then display the first series of questions
    
    this can be accomplished by setting the display to block

when user clicks on an answer, then they will get a message saying whether or not they got it right, this will remove 10 seconds from counter

    this can be done with if statements maybe?

then the next question will display

this will continue until user runs out of time OR quiz is complete

repeat until quiz is completed...
