This is a short LOTR based quiz.

There is a running timer, when the timer reaches 0 the game ends. For each incorrect answer, 10 seconds are removed from the timer.

Once the user selects the finish quiz button, their final score is displayed. They can enter their name, I got as far as it being stored in local storage but not past that point.
